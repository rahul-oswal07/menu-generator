# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Menu Generator is an application that processes menu images using AI to extract text content and then generates visual representations of the actual dishes described in the menu. This system combines optical character recognition (OCR), natural language processing, and AI image generation to transform static menu text into appealing dish images.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a restaurant customer, I want to upload a photo of a menu, so that I can see what the dishes actually look like before ordering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an image file THEN the system SHALL accept common image formats (JPEG, PNG, WEBP)
2. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate the file size is under 10MB
3. WHEN an invalid file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN a valid image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL display a preview of the uploaded menu image

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically read and extract menu text from my uploaded image, so that I don't have to manually type out menu items.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a menu image is processed THEN the system SHALL extract text using OCR technology
2. WHEN text extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL identify individual menu items and descriptions
3. WHEN menu items are detected THEN the system SHALL parse dish names, descriptions, and prices separately
4. WHEN text extraction fails THEN the system SHALL notify the user and suggest image quality improvements
5. WHEN extracted text is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL allow manual correction of menu items

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to generate realistic images of the dishes from the menu text, so that I can visualize what I'm ordering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN menu items are extracted THEN the system SHALL generate dish images using AI image generation
2. WHEN generating images THEN the system SHALL use dish names and descriptions as prompts
3. WHEN image generation is complete THEN the system SHALL display generated images alongside menu text
4. WHEN image generation fails for an item THEN the system SHALL show a placeholder and error message
5. WHEN multiple dishes are processed THEN the system SHALL generate images in batches to optimize performance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view the generated dish images in an organized layout, so that I can easily browse and compare different menu options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dish images are generated THEN the system SHALL display them in a grid or card layout
2. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show dish name, description, price, and generated image together
3. WHEN viewing results THEN the system SHALL allow users to zoom in on individual dish images
4. WHEN results are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide options to save or share individual dish images
5. WHEN no dishes are detected THEN the system SHALL display a helpful message with troubleshooting tips

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully, so that I have a smooth experience even when things go wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN processing takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators
3. WHEN the system encounters rate limits THEN the system SHALL queue requests and notify users of delays
4. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL allow users to retry operations
5. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors for debugging while maintaining user privacy

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to be responsive and fast, so that I can quickly see dish images without long waiting times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading images THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback and progress indicators
2. WHEN processing menu text THEN the system SHALL complete OCR within 10 seconds for typical menu images
3. WHEN generating dish images THEN the system SHALL show progress for batch operations
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL load images progressively to improve perceived performance
5. WHEN the system is busy THEN the system SHALL provide estimated wait times to users
